When dealing with keypresses, the tipical is
# reads out what the current options are (can have single be one thing and hold be everything)
Use a syle of
    1) find what key was pressed
    2) Make radio/system update/changes
    3) Set path for next key press
    4) output to user about what new path is

With modes
Have a function with a common name of {Mode* [fileName]Loader()}
The enter and exit function are null unless populated
Only relise on General* (TODO make this a posibility)
